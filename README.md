# RSA challenge with halo2 and Aleph Zero

_A brief tutorial on how to write, deploy and interact with smart contracts utilizing ZK proofs on Aleph Zero blockchain._

Our working example is _RSA challenge_ game.
The idea is that we have a number `n` which is a product of two primes `p` and `q`.
`n` is publicly known, but `p` and `q` are secret.
The challenge is to factorize `n`.
The person, who solves this riddle first, wins the game and gets some reward.

# Contract

In the [rsa_contract](./rsa_contract) directory you can find the contract crate.
It represents the challenge as an ink! smart contract.
Once deployed, it allows anyone to submit a solution to the challenge.
The first accepted solution wins the reward and terminates the contract.

Since a blockchain is a public ledger, we have to hide the solution from the public, so that nobody can steal our credit.
To do so, we use a ZK proofs. A participant doesn't send `p` and `q` directly, but instead sends a proof that they know such `p` and `q` that factorize `n`.

The only thing that the contract has to do, is to verify such a proof.
Since this can be a very expensive operation in WASM, we outsource this heavy computation to the on-chain verifier, that should be much more efficient.
For curious minds, the verification is outsourced via a _chain extension_.

### Front-running prevention

Even when using ZK proofs, there is still a possibility of front-running.
Imagine that we are sending a proof that we know `p` and `q` that factorize `n`.
Now, anybody can just copy this proof and send it to the contract before us, stealing our reward!.

To prevent this, we additionally include our own public key in the proof.
This way, the contract can also verify that indeed it was the caller, who should get the reward.

# Circuit

The [rsa_circuit](./rsa_circuit) directory contains the circuit crate.
It is written with Aleph Zero's halo2 fork.
It also exposes some utilities for generating proofs and data serialization (please notice, that some conventions that are expected from the on-chain verifier are sometimes still very implicit).

# Client

In the [client](./client) directory you can find a simple CLI that interacts with the whole system.
Let us assume that we have a running node at `ws://localhost:9944`.
Then, we can run an experiment as follows:

```bash
cd client/
# We build the client.
cargo build --release

# We generate the SNARK setup (SRS, proving and verifying keys).
./target/release/client setup-snark

‚è≥ Submitting solution...
‚úÖ Loaded SNARK proof from `submission-data`
‚è≥ Calling contract...
‚úÖ Contract called
‚úÖ Challenge solved!
```

> Note: all the chain and contract interactions are done with seed phrase `//Alice`.

In case our proof is invalid, we will get an error:

```bash
‚è≥ Submitting solution...
‚úÖ Loaded SNARK proof from `submission-data`
‚è≥ Calling contract...
‚úÖ Contract called
‚ùå Challenge not solved, proof found to be incorrect
```

# Exploiting the contract

The circuit itself has a little, but critical bug üêõ.
It is possible to generate a valid proof for a wrong solution, that will be accepted by the contract.
We encourage you to find this exploit and steal the reward!

# Launching a local chain

In order to launch a local Aleph Zero chain with ZK utilities, you can either:
- run a single-node chain with Docker: simply run `./launch-chain.sh`,
- or run `./scripts/run_nodes.sh --liminal` on the `main` branch from [`aleph-zero`](https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/aleph-node) repository.
